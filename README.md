# AxisAndOhsTemplates

Templates for mapping Honeycomb Alpha yoke and Honeycomb Bravo throttle quadrant buttons to Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 commands using [Axis and Ohs](https://axisandohs.weebly.com/).

## Buttons/switches to unbind

The following buttons and switches should be unbound from Flight Simulator before using these templates:

### Alpha yoke

* All battery and avionics switches
* All light switches
* All magneto knob positions

### Bravo throttle quadrant

* All bindings for both auto pilot knobs
* All auto pilot buttons, including the big auto pilot button above the flaps lever
* Flaps lever
* All switches below the auto pilot buttons

## What's mapped

All the switches on the Alpha are mapped as printed on the yoke. This includes all lights operating correctly.

All auto-pilot switches on the Bravo are mapped as printed on the throttle quadrant with a few additions:

* Press and hold on HDG will set the heading bug to the current heading
* Press and hold on the auto pilot switch will enable/disable the flight director
* Fast spin on the incr/decr knob will increase/decrease the selected setting more rapidly
* From left to right the switches are mapped as follows:
   * Fuel pump
   * Pitot heat
